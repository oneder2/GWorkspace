## PWA Icons

For PWA support, you need to add the following icon files:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 PNG icon
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 PNG icon  
- `favicon.ico` - Favicon file
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 PNG for Apple devices

These icons will be used by the PWA manifest and for app installation prompts.
